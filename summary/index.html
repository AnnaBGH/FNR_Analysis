The primary aim of this project was to invesitgate whether it might now be possible to build open tools, using open data that could be deployed by policy makers considering changes to public services - but which also could be open to the general public.
</p>

<p>
Emergency services across the country (and worldwide) have been using consultations and computer modelling to make decisions about how they plan provision for years. But this work is going on largely behind closed doors. This makes it hard for planners to show their “workings out” and provide an evidence base for the choices they are making and for those who are interested to really test the likely impacts. 
</p>

<p>
We were also keen to explore what could be achieved when a significant commercial partner, Telefonica Dynamic Insights, was prepared to release some of its data as open data and we combined this with public sector open data. One of the core missions of the ODI is to show how open data can bring social, environmental and economic benefits to society. The most powerful examples of this are likely to be generated when we combine public sector and private sector open datasets. Using the crowd data in this project is a powerful demonstrator of that in action.

<h3>Why London Fire Data?</h3>

<p>With ten fire stations to close in London, there was a clear case to investigate the potential of developing tools that apply to a live "use case".</p>

<p>Additionally, while similar work has been carried out before, the vast majority has been done behind closed doors. We wanted see if it was possible to carry out an analysis using open data and in an open way, making the analysis and the tools as easily accessible to both policy-makers and citizens as possible.</p>

<p>With a very short time scale for the project, being able to refer scientifically to existing work allowed us to speed up our own reseach while critically evaluating our findings against that of others.</p>

<h3>So what did we find?</h3>

<p>Firstly it is important to emphasize that this project was carried out in a very short time scale and while we have made every effort to peer review our mathematical models, there is still work to be done in this area before we can draw any solid conclusions. It is also important to note that this is the first time that commercially available data on actual footfall has been used alongside open government data, thus there is no previous work openly available to refer to or learn from. As such we currently offer no guarantees over the accuracy of the results themselves.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking our results appear to reflect those of the in-depth consultation carried out for the London Fire Brigade using only a fraction of the data that is available as open data.</p>

<p>It is clear that open data is extremely valuable in order to allow citizens and bodies interested in public welfare such as ourselves to carry out their own analysis. Being able to combine open government data with relevant commercial data provides an  unparalleled level of transparency that has never been seen before. But we are not done yet, there are still many datasets not available that would only improve the analysis of this data.</p>

<p>Importantly, we have found it is possible to build an analytical tool that is capable of processing hundreds of thousands of rows of data in real time.</p>
